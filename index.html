       My Education began at <a href="https://www.gsu.edu/"><strong>Georgia State university</strong></a> where I studied communication
       for two years.Then when I began to finish up my last two classes to earn my Assoicates degree
       I dropped out. I remeber I said quote "FUCK tHIS SHIT.I aint doing this
      old bulshit"What I meant was great men dont go to college no. Great tackle
      the head on when their creativity and theor god given talent and thats What
     I became a fuckin legend.

      <li>
        After I dropped out of college I went to a program A one year program that
        promise an opprtunity to land a job with a coporate america. This was the way
        I could of gain capital to fund my music so that the music career can fund makleno.
        I went to the program for the whole year despite I not being the most idle
        student I still manage to pass and landed a job with a pest control company.
        From there I learned my skills as a hacker network engineer/ Developer.
